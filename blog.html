            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Introduction: The Problem</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Social media is extremely valuable to companies, organizations, or individuals to promote themselves or some product. Users can choose to produce a high volume of content, as well as carefully create “viral” posts which can have a large influence for minimal cost. But what can contribute to making these viral posts, and how can we utilize these ideas? In this project (which was an assignment for CPSC 330), I explored this question using a dataset of tweets from former U.S. President Donald Trump. My objective was to predict whether a tweet would go viral (defined here as receiving more than 10,000 retweets) based solely on its text content.</p>

        <!-- Dataset Section -->
        <section id="dataset" class="mb-6">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Understanding the Dataset</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">The dataset contained 43,352 tweets posted by Trump up to June 2020. Each row represented a single tweet, including its timestamp, content, retweet count, favorite count, and metadata like mentions and hashtags.

                For this analysis, I focused only on the tweet text (content) and its retweet count (retweets). My target variable was a binary indicator of whether a tweet surpassed 10,000 retweets.
                The dataset's scale allowed robust analysis, but it also meant dealing with noisy text data and potentially biased patterns due to Trump’s unique tweeting style.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-2">Overall Distribution of Tweets in Dataset:</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">We can also take note of where most of the tweets end up in relation to our definition of viral in <strong>figure 1</strong>. Note that 10^4 is our threshold for a viral tweet.</p>

        <!-- Model Section -->
        <section id="model" class="mb-6">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Model</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">To predict virality, I used a logistic regression model, which is great for binary classification tasks. The text data was converted into numerical format using a CountVectorizer, which encodes text as word frequencies. This pipeline was evaluated using 4-fold cross-validation, ensuring that the model's performance was consistent across different data splits. In <strong>figure 2</strong>, we can see that 4-fold was chosen due to its optimal accuracy.</p>
        </br>
                <p class="text-gray-700">Baseline Comparison: Before applying logistic regression, I used a simple DummyClassifier, which always predicts the most frequent class (non-viral tweets). This baseline provided a useful benchmark.</p>

        <!-- Results Section -->
        <section id="results" class="mb-6">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Results</h2>
            <h2 class="text-3x font-semibold mb-2">Model and Scores</h2>
            <list>
                <li>Logistic Regression achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 89.5%, significantly outperforming the DummyClassifier’s 74.2%.
                    This demonstrates that the logistic regression model is effectively learning patterns from the tweet content that relate with virality, unlike the DummyClassifier, which just predicts the majority class without using any information from the data.</li>
                <li class="mb-4">The 5-fold cross-validation scores for logistic regression were consistent, ranging from 89.0% to 90.0%, indicating stable performance.
                    This stability across folds suggests that the model's predictions generalize well to unseen data, reducing concerns about overfitting or model performance being overly dependent on specific subsets of the training data.</li>
            </list>
            <h2 class="text-3x font-semibold mb-2">Word Impact</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Consider <strong>figure 3</strong> which shows the top and bottom 5 words according to the coefficient score.</p>
            <list>
                <li class="text-gray-700">High-impact Words: The model revealed which words were most strongly associated with virality. Words like "democrats," "coronavirus," and "fake" were among the top contributors to a tweet going viral, reflecting Trump's often provocative tone.</li>
                <li class="mb-6 text-gray-700">Low-impact Words: Conversely, words like "realdonaldtrump," "thanks," and "barackobama" were associated with non-viral tweets, likely due to their generic or frequent use.</li>
            </list>
            <img src="assets/330-plot2.PNG" alt="Additional visualization" class="w-1/3 mx-auto h-auto mt-4 rounded shadow">
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 text-center mt-2">Figure 3: Word coefficient value in tweets (higher = high association with viral tweets)</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">The Most Viral Tweet</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">The tweet with the highest predicted probability of virality was:
                "I will be giving a big speech at the MAGA rally tonight. Watch it live at 7 PM!"
                Predicted probability of virality: 99.3%
                
                This tweet likely scored high due to engaging language, a clear call-to-action, and alignment with Trump's audience's interests. </p>

        <!-- Caveats Section -->
        <section id="caveats" class="mb-6">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Caveats and Limitations</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700">One way the results may be misleading is I did not spent a ton of time optimizing hyperparameters. For example, max_iter (maximum iterations) for the Logistic Regression was set to a arbitrary value when I could have spent more time testing out different ones. Tuning these more could yield better results.</p>
            </br>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Another way the results may be inaccurate is the use of just CountVectorizer. The tweets likely contain information that requires context so using a different strategy like text embedding would lead to better results. CountVectorizer just considers frequency of words which does not always capture the signficance of them.</p>
            </br>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Lastly, it would be useful to clean the data a bit and get rid of words that do not make a lot of sense. For example, the top 5 words are all distinct and real words, while 4/5 of the bottom ones are names or words combined into one. These likely are not that valuable for determining the best words for a viral tweet.</p>
